# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Background
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to help the manager of Pewlett Hackard prepare for and mitigate effects of a large number of employees retiring.

1) Determine the Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2) Determine the Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results
- Query to create Retirement Titles table for employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
